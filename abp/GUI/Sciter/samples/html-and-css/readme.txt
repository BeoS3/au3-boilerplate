Please use samples in /html_samples/ folder of htmlayout SDK.
You can find it here: http://www.terrainformatica.com/htmlayout/HTMLayoutDemo.zip

Note: not all samples in /html_samples/behaviors/ will work as not all native behaviors implementations
are in sciter.exe. If needed these behviors can easily be ported as native behaviors if the Sciter or 
as scripting behaviors using correspondent class ... : Behavior {} constructions.
