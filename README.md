AutoIt Boilerplate
===================
_A collection of my UDFs, modified and unmodified UDFs from some other authors and general AutoIt snippets_

## Important notes
 - It's still in an early alpha stage, so core changes are expected
 - always only the newest stable version of AutoIt is supported

### Useful when:

- you want to deploy a new installation of AutoIt and start scripting without searching for the UDFs over and over again
- you already have an instance of AutoIt and want to start scripting without searching for the UDFs over and over again

###### Published in the hope that it will be useful
