SQLite_Encryption
=============

An AutoIt wrapper around SQLite3 API providing encryption support

### Requirements:
- **sqlite3.dll** with **encryption support** (you can use any, but if you don't have one I recommend to use wxSQLite3 for which [I've setup a MS Visual Studio solution](https://github.com/rindeal/wxSQLite3-VS), so it's pretty easy to build)
